==Introduction==
===General===
The API attempts to conform to the design principles of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer Representational State Transfer] (REST).

The API presently supports the following data formats: XML, JSON, and the RSS and Atom syndication formats, with some methods only accepting a subset of these formats.

The following requests a JSON response format by using the "json" extension:

`http://api.feedzilla.com/v1/cultures.json`

Parameter values should be converted to UTF-8 and URL encoded.

All Feedzilla APIs support an optional return format parameter. Note that json is the default response format. XML is also available. Some endpoints also support a simple txt format. 
{{{
.json
}}}
All Feedzilla APIs support jsonp which is the json format with a callback specified, such as:
{{{
.json&callback=callback_method
}}}
The application communicating with a resource does not need information concerning firewalls, gateways, proxies or other network devices between the application and the server holding the resource.

All dates will be treated as UTC and their formats must be YYYY-DD-MM.

All published date time objects are UTC based and conform to [http://asg.web.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc822.html RFC822.]

===Response Codes and Error Messages===
====HTTP Status Codes====

The Feedzilla API attempts to return appropriate HTTP status codes for every request.

    * *200 OK*: Success!
    * *304 Not Modified*: There was no new data to return.
    * *400 Bad Request*: The request was invalid.  An accompanying error message will explain why.
    * *403 Forbidden*: The request is understood, but it has been refused.  An accompanying error message will explain why. 
    * *404 Not Found*: The URI requested is invalid or the resource requested, such as a category, does not exists.
    * *500 Internal Server Error*: Something is broken. 
    * *502 Bad Gateway*: Feedzilla is down or being upgraded.
    * *503 Service Unavailable*: The Feedzilla servers are up, but overloaded with requests. Try again later.

====Error Messages====

When the API returns error messages, it does so in your requested format. For example, an error from an XML method might look like this:

{{{
    <error>
        <statuscode>400</statuscode>
        <statusdescription>The specified order is invalid</statusdescription>
    </error>
}}}

====A command line is all you need to use the Feedzilla API====
If your system has [http://curl.haxx.se/ curl] (and it should!), youâ€™ve already got a great way to poke around the Feedzilla API.

====Entity-encoded HTML in Title, Description (Summary)  and Content====
The Title, Description (Summary) and Content fields might contain entity-encoded HTML. To be able to display these fields as HTML they must be entity-decoded.
