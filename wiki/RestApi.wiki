==Introduction==
===General===
The API attempts to conform to the design principles of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer Representational State Transfer] (REST).

The API presently supports the following data formats: XML, JSON, and the RSS and Atom syndication formats, with some methods only accepting a subset of these formats.

The following requests a JSON response format by using the "json" extension:
{{{
http://api.feedzilla.com/v1/cultures.json
}}}
Parameter values should be converted to UTF-8 and URL encoded.

All Feedzilla APIs support an optional return format parameter. Note that json is the default response format. XML is also available. Some endpoints also support a simple txt format. 
{{{
.json
}}}
